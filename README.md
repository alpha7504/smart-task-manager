# Smart Task Manager  

This is my first project. Itâ€™s a simple task manager made using **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.  
You can add tasks, mark them as done, edit them, or delete them.  
There is also a **progress bar** that shows how many tasks are completed.  
The tasks are saved in your browser, so they stay even if you refresh.
